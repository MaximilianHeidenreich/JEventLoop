<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

I created this project because I needed it for my [JNet]() and [EnderSync]() projects. 
Everything else I found online might have worked but would result in too much boilerplate code or
just had an API that was pretty big.
I just wanted a simple EventLoop without* any other dependencies which could process my events.

This project aims to achieve these goals.


### Project Goals

- [x] Events
    - [x] Queue events
    - [x] Handle events with multiple custom handler functions
    - [x] Prioritize specific events if necessary
- [x] Callbacks
    - [x] Queue events with callbacks which can be executed from inside event handlers.
